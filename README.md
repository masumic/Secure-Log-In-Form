Secure Login System
A simple client-server login system built with Python that stores and validates user credentials using an SQL database.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a secure login mechanism using two Python scripts:
Client: Collects username and password, then sends them to the Server.
Server: Validates credentials by querying a database and sends back success or error messages.

Features
Client-Server Architecture: Uses sockets to establish a connection between Client and Server.
SQL Database: Stores usernames and passwords in a table.
Terminal UI: Users input credentials through the command line.
Error Handling: Provides descriptive error messages for invalid credentials or server connection issues.
